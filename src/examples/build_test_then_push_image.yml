  This is an example of a job that builds a docker image with docker buildx. It tests
  the image and before pushing it to the specified ECR repository.
  NOTE: The push_image parameter must be set to false. Only one platform can be specified and
  loaded into the local Docker Daemon. Loading multi-architecture images is not supported at this time.
